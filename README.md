# UnifyID-Coding-Challenge
Camden Ko's submission for UnifyID Coding Challenge

## How to run
 - install packages
    - PIL (Pillow)
     - struct
     - jsonrpcclient
 - in secrets.py set `randomAPI = 'YOUR_RANDOM.ORG_API_KEY'
 - run `python` on `main.py`

## Outputs
  - audioWAV.wav => the 3s random WAV file
  - randomImg.bmp => the 128x128 random BMP file

## On the topic of RSA
Due to time constraints, I was unable to get the RSA portion of the challenge working, however some of the code is still inside if you wish to take a look. My plan was to use Random.org to generate a random odd number that I would then use as the public key for the RSA Agent.

###### Final Note:
This is one of my first times using python, so some of the coding conventions may not adhere to best practices for python.
